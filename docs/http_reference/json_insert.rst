json/insert
-----------

Documents can be inserted into RT indexes using the ``/json/insert`` endpoint. As with SphinxQL's :ref:`insert_and_replace_syntax`, documents with ids that already exist will not be overwritten. You can also use the ``/json/create`` endpoint, it's a synonym for ``json/insert``.

Here's how you can index a simple document:

::

	{
	  "index":"test",
	  "id":1
	}

This creates a document with an id specified by ``id`` in an index specified by the ``index`` property. This document has empty fulltext fields and all attributes are set to their default values. However, you can use the optional ``doc`` property to set field and attribute values:

::

	{
	  "index":"test",
	  "id":1,
	  "doc":
	  {
	    "gid" : 10,
	    "content" : "new document"
	  }
	}

The daemon will respond with a JSON object stating if the operation was successfull or not:

::
   
   {
    "_index": "test",
    "_id": 1,
    "created": true,
    "result": "created"
  }
  
  
MVA attributes are inserted as arrays of numbers. JSON attributes can be inserted either as JSON objects or as strings containing escaped JSON:

::

  {
    "index":"test",
    "id":1,
    "doc":
    {
      "mva" : [1,2,3,4,5],
      "json1":
      {
        "string": "name1",
        "int": 1,
        "array" : [100,200],
        "object": {}
      },
      "json2": "{\"string\":\"name2\",\"int\":2,\"array\":[300,400],\"object\":{}}",
      "content" : "new document"
    }
  }
  

To index a document in a cluster's index ``cluster`` property should be set along with ``index`` property:

::

	{
	  "cluster":"nodes4",
	  "index":"test",
	  "id":1,
	  "doc":
	  {
	    "gid" : 10,
	    "content" : "new document"
	  }
	}

   documents indexed and their text size in bytes, respectively.
-  **field_tokens_XXX**, sums of per-field lengths (in tokens) over
   the entire index (that is used internally in BM25A and BM25F
   functions for ranking purposes). Only available for indexes built
   with index_field_lengths=1.
-  **ram_bytes**, total size (in bytes) of the RAM-resident index
   portion.

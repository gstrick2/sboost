SHOW META syntax
----------------

.. code-block:: mysql


    SHOW META [ LIKE pattern ]

**SHOW META** shows additional meta-information about the latest
query such as query time and keyword statistics. IO and CPU counters
will only be available if searchd was started with –iostats and
–cpustats switches respectively. Additional predicted_time,
dist_predicted_time, [{local\|dist}]*fetched*\ [{docs\|hits\|skips}]
counters will only be available if searchd was configured with
:ref:`predicted time
costs <predicted_time_costs>`
and query had predicted_time in OPTION clause.
SHOW META needs to run right after the query was execute in the **same** session.
As some mysql connectors/libraries use connection pools, running SHOW META in a separate statement 
can lead to unexpected results like getting meta from another query. 
In these cases (and recommended in general) is to run a multiple statement containing query + SHOW META.
Some connectors/libraries support o multi-queries on same method for single statement, other may require usage
of a dedicated method for multi-queries or setting specific options at connection setup.

You can also use the optional LIKE clause. It lets you pick just the
variables that match a pattern. The pattern syntax is that of regular
SQL wildcards, that is, ‘%’ means any number of any characters, and '_'
means a single character:

.. code-block:: mysql


    mysql> SHOW META LIKE 'total%';
    +-----------------------+-------+
    | Variable_name         | Value |
    +-----------------------+-------+
    | total                 | 3     |
    | total_found           | 3     |
    +-----------------------+-------+
    2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

	
SHOW META can be used after executing a :ref:`CALL PQ <call_pq_syntax>`  statement.
In this case, it provides a different :ref:`output <percolate_query_show_meta>`.

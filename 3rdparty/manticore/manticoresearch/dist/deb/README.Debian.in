Manticore
------------

searchd will start automatically however the default configuration does not supply
any indexes. Therefore, searchd will not continue running. You have to edit
@SYSCONFDIR@/manticoresearch/manticore.conf to get any meaningful mode of operation.

Documentation is available in @DOCDIRFULL@.
